[O2A](https://o2a-data.de/) consists of a comprehensive set of solutions designed to support users in their scientific workflows. 


This repository specifically provides examples and code snippets in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [python](https://www.python.org/) 
on how to access certain services from the O2A universe, in order to conduct [FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) 
and reproducible state of the art data driven research. 

These services are: 

- [REGISTRY](https://registry.o2a-data.de/) -- an authoritative repository for managing platform, device and sensor-related information, and 
- the [Data Web Service](https://dashboard.awi.de/data/) -- a near real-time database and aggregation service.

# Training

If you are a newbie in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), we recommend you to have a look at the training material from  [dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial), in addition to the tutorial on using the R programming language from [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/), or in [this blog](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/jupyter-notebook-r).

Additionally the various workshops offered by [the carpentries](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/) have proven to be valuable for an introduction to data wrangling.
