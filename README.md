# o2a-data-dws

[O2A](https://www.awi.de/data-flow) consists of a comprehensive set of solutions designed to support users in their scientific workflows.  
<!--Among other tasks, we are dedicated to publish examples of analysis tools for supporting direct access to various backends (flat files, relational databases, hadoop, etc).-->

This repository specifically provides examples in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [python](https://www.python.org/) 
on how to access services from the O2A universe 
for the purpose of download, blend, and analyze near real-time data in a [FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) and 
[reproducible](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) manner.
Items generating data are described in detail under [registry](https://registry.o2a-data.de/).
Measurement data originates from the O2A near real-time database [dashboard](https://dashboard.o2a-data.de). 


# Examples 

<!-- In this section we list all examples which have been developed so far. The list will be growing as an increasing number of use cases for O2A are being tested.-->

# Training

If you are a newbie in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), we recommend you to have a look at the training material from  [dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial), in addition to the tutorial on using the R programming language from [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/), or in [this blog](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/jupyter-notebook-r).

Additionally the various workshops offered by [the carpentries](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/) have proven to be valuable for an introduction to data wrangling.
