# o2a-data-dws

[O2A](https://www.awi.de/data-flow) consists of a comprehensive set of solutions designed to support users in their scientific workflows.  Among other tasks, we are dedicated to publish examples of analysis tools for supporting direct access to various backends (flat files, relational databases, hadoop, etc).

The "o2a-data-dws" specifically provides examples in R and python on how to access data services for the purpose of dowload, analysis and visualization og near real-time data displayed in [DASHBOARD](https://dashboard.awi.de) using Jupyter Notebooks.  The devices and sensors generating data are described in detail under [SENSOR](https://sensor.awi.de).



# Examples 

In this section we list all examples which have been developed so far. The list will be growing as an increasing number of use cases for O2A are being tested.


Example | Description 
--- | --- 
[Example in PY](dws-py-intro.ipynb) | Analytics and visualization of NRT temperature data from various sensors extracted from Svalbard Station.  .
[Example in R](dws-r-intro.ipynb) |  Analytics and visualization of NRT temperature data from various sensors extracted from Svalbard Station.  
[WS](dws.R) |  Data web services in R.
[WS](dws.py) |  Data web services in python
